  ## Summary
  The Five Star unpaid review percentage was found to be 38.9% while the paid Five Star review percentage was found to be 48.9%. This is a signicant difference in percentage which could suggest that there is a positivity bias with the Vine program. However, there were only 94 vine reviews and well over 40,000 non-Vine reviews. Since the sample size for the vine reviews is so much smaller than the non-Vine reviews we can not confidently conclude the presence of positivity bias.
  
  A further analysis that could be done to provide evidence to prove or disprove the presence of positivity bias would be to find the mean, median, and mode for the ratings of the non-paid and paid reviews.
